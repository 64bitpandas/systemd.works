### **We read and discuss research papers on computer systems every other Sunday.**

 - Primary topics include databases, OS, compilers and networking.
 - We also read papers about AI/ML, security, and algorithms.

Our goal is to make current systems research accessible and enjoyable for anyone with a general interest in computer science.
