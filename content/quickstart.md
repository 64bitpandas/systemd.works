Welcome to systemd.works! If it's your first time joining, here are some resources and ground rules so you know what to expect :)

## Quick References
 - **Google Meet link:** Check your RSVP email! (Unless something changes, this will be the same for every session)
 - **Discord:** https://systemd.works/discord
 - **Current paper:** See the homepage (https://systemd.works)
 - **View/suggest backlog papers:** See the Notion page (https://systemd.works/notion)
 - **View past discussion summaries:** See the posts page (https://systemd.works/posts)

## Schedule
Our discussions are very free-form, loosely following this schedule:
 - 1:30-1:40: Welcome, introductions
 - 1:40-2:00: Background and summary
 - 2:00-2:20: Discussion on takeaways, extrapolations, and related research
 - 2:20-2:30: Closing thoughts and next week's paper selection

**We don't allocate time for reading.** You'll probably have a better time if you at least do a quick read-through of the paper before joining the meeting- but if you're just here to listen in, that's fine too!

Sometimes, we'll read two papers in one two-week session. The schedule may change for these occurrences.

## Ground Rules
We trust that if you're here, you're looking for a friendly and productive discussion :) There's a few things that would be great for you to keep in mind as you arrive:
 - **We welcome anyone** who's interested in the topics we're covering, regardless of experience. Don't be afraid to ask basic questions if you get lost in the discussion- and please be respectful of those with less experience than you!
 - **This isn't a classroom**; there is no expectation for anyone to actively participate or have done the reading. We are all here because we want to learn, and how you go by this is totally up to you.
 - **Feel free to invite your friends!** Our events are always open to the public.

## Contributing
We publish a writeup of our discussions on [systemd.works](https://systemd.works) for the benefit of the general public and those of you who can't make every session. If you're interested in writing one, simply let us know at the end of the discussion and we'll guide you through the process of publishing it!

This website is open source. If you find bugs or have a feature request, please make a pull request or issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/64bitpandas/systemd.works).

If there are enough interested writers who want to contribute more consistently, we might consider starting a weekly newsletter sometime soon :)
