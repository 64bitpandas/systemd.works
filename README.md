# systemd.works

We read and discuss a research paper on computer systems every other Sunday.

 - Primary topics include databases, OS, compilers and networking.
 - We also read papers about AI/ML, security, and algorithms.

Our goal is to make current systems research accessible and enjoyable for anyone with a general interest in computer science.

Sound interesting? [**RSVP for the next session here.**](https://lu.ma/calendar/cal-iRO3oIDMdgOoGEE)

This site is built using Hugo with the PaperMod theme. You'll need to first [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) then run `hugo serve`. A development server should then be available at `localhost:1313`.
